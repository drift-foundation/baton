"""W183883 claim188818 — one probe for the refusal that must not promise.

Review 2026-09-16T19-25-41Z: the public refusal asserted that anything this
attempt made had been unwound -- even when the cleanup had just printed that it
could not remove a file, which was still there.

Every probe proves a PASSING BASELINE on pristine code first [J1].

Run against an isolated COPY of the tree. Nothing here edits the checkout.
