"""W103525 claim157538: the composed-owner artifact set, with the four-Job
schedule REACHING INTEGRATION.

Run from `v12/python` with `PYTHONPATH=src:tools:.`; refuses to overwrite.

Review 2026-09-13T04:11:17Z found what claim157442's `answering` boundary
actually was, and it was my own fixture: the borrowed composed case pins its
policy generation in `setUp`, and `four_works` then performs real Authority acts
-- two `create_work`s, four `add_route_handler`s and two `grant_capability`s --
every one of which moves the generation. The deployment concluded under a
generation the Authority had moved past and `conclude` deferred `policy/denied`.
The reviews were never the problem; the CONCLUSION was. `current_policy` reads
the Authority's generation after the setup acts and before the composition.

So both bounded schedules now complete all six stages, and the cross-Job edge
opens. A third case follows them with ordinary ticks: `job-b/implementation`
becomes real work on its own producer, and ONE configured integration worker
serializes the three Jobs that are ready -- exactly one integrating, the rest
queued. That is the separately configured integration capacity the PLAN names.

WHAT IS SIMULATED, NAMED. The worker entry, the workload, the Job and Worker
Manager owners, the Authority and the review cycles are the real ones; the
container engine is a scripted seam and the provider is a deterministic child
process, not a live model.

`trace-157442-composed.json` is retained as history: its `answering` schedules
are what the stale pin produced and are superseded, not deleted.

KEYED BY SCENARIO NAME, not by method. The alternate-order case builds TWO traces
in one run -- that is the whole point of it -- so an exporter that kept only the
last artifact per method would have dropped one of them.
