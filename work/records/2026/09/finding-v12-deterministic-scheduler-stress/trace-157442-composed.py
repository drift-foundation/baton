"""W103525 claim157442: the composed-owner artifact set, with the four-Job
schedule DRIVEN.

Run from `v12/python` with `PYTHONPATH=src:tools:.`; refuses to overwrite.

Review 2026-09-13T03:54:02Z accepted the two-team and claim corrections and asked
for actual producer and reviewer turns. Both bounded orders are here -- A before
C and C before A -- and in each one three independent Jobs take REAL producer
turns on three producers from two teams and complete their implementations, then
are really reviewed by their own reviewers.

WHERE THE SCHEDULE STOPS IS MEASURED AND CARRIED WITH IT. Every review turn
returns zero and its verdict is written, and the stage then stays `answering`
with a null settlement on an ending that exists -- so the cross-Job edge does not
open. That is a gap in each schedule's own artifact, with the projection's own
evidence, rather than a completion this exporter claims.

EVERY TICK OF A SCHEDULE IS OBSERVED. The fixture's `produced` helper drives
ticks to completion itself, and ticks a trace never saw are what made the oracle
report a successor reserved before its prerequisite -- correctly. These schedules
take the container turn and then observe every tick that follows.

KEYED BY SCENARIO NAME, not by method. The alternate-order case builds TWO traces
in one run -- that is the whole point of it -- so an exporter that kept only the
last artifact per method would have dropped one of them.
